					<h3>Don't lose your Mojo</h3>
					<em>Feb. 14, 2012</em>
					<p>Happy Valentine's day! I should really get to sleep (it's almost 3 a.m.), but this week is <strong>Mojo week</strong>. <a href="http://mojo.dailybruin.com">Mojo</a> is my latest project from the Daily Bruin. It's a blog focused entirely on mobile content: reporters see good stories and post pictures/text/video to the blog as quickly as possible. <a href="http://mojo.dailybruin.com">Check it out</a> and tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/dbmojo">@dbmojo</a> to give us story ideas, photos, or whatever you'd like.</p>
