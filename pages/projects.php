	<p>Here are some of my random projects (computer science, design, etc.). This will grow as needed. Please don't copy any of the design work; it's illegal. <span class="tiptip" title="Sorry, I'm not trying to just be mean; some of this work is not owned by me, it's owned by people who have employed me. I can't let you use anything from those designs without their permission.">If you want any of it, <a href="p?=contact">send me a message</a> and we can work something out</span>.</p>
