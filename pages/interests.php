	<p>Here are some of my favorite hobbies, bands, books, etc. If you feel like being an ultimate stalker (or buying me something, hint hint), here's your chance!</p>
	<h3>Music</h3>
	<p>I'm obsessed with <a class="tiptip" href="http://spotify.com/" title="I don't have Spotify premium yet, but it's something I plan to buy">Spotify</a> as a great way to listen to music for free and share music. However, since artists don't get much money from Spotify listens, I still try to buy their songs. Here are some artists I love:</p>
	<ul class="simple">
		<li><a class="blocklink" href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/4vzLZN7MD9TVnsLK7bR5oF">Lady Danville</a> (they even went to UCLA!)</li>
		<li><a class="blocklink" href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/3GBPw9NK25X1Wt2OUvOwY3">Jack Johnson</a></li>
		<li><a class="blocklink" href="http://redhotchilipeppers.com/">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a></li>
	</ul>
