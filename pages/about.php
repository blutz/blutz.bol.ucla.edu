		<p>Hey there! My name is <strong>Byron Lutz</strong>. In Old English, my name means "Barn," but in Mandarin it sounds like the phrase "White Man" (白人) After a quick look at my Swiss/German/Irish skin, it's obvious the name is appropriate. (As for how I'm a barn&#8230; I'll let someone else figure that out.)</p>
		<p>All my life, I grew up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=95366&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.144864,69.609375&t=h&z=11">Northern California</a>; I graduated from <a href="http://www.cchsca.org/">Central Catholic High School</a> in Modesto in 2010, and now I'm studying Computer Science at UCLA.</p>
		<p>I enjoy a lot of little things: programming, whipped cream, good country music, running, nice people, random science, being outdoors, words, &hellip;</p>
		<p>Below are descriptions of some activities I participate in. I'll try my best to keep it up to date, but if you really want the most up-to-date version, <a href="?p=contact">contact me</a>.</p>

	<p>Every summer of my childhood, I went up to Camp Silver Lake for 4-H Camp; in high school, I became a counselor at that camp. Now when I look back, I realize that camp was an incredibly important part of growing up. There's just some "magic" about being outdoors with a bunch of other kids, away from home, playing and doing whatever I feel like. A few people at UCLA saw this magic of going outdoors, but they realized some kids' families can't afford it: camp is <em>expensive</em>! So they started UniCamp, a place where campers pay less than a fifth of the cost of the camp so they can come up to the mountains and just be kids.</p>
	<p>As a counselor (of 10-year-old boys), I realized that this experience means a lot to the kids. For most of them, UniCamp is their only opportunity all year to be out of the city. As a camp, we make it a goal to have outcome-based programming. This year, the theme was goal setting: trying to kick-start these kids into setting goals for their futures. Some of them absorbed more than others, but they all enjoyed being in the mountains and were glad for a break from being home.</p>
	<p>I'm glad I volunteered for UniCamp: I hope I made a difference in the kids' lives; they made a difference in mine.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to donate, send me an <a href="?p=contact">email</a>. Every year I have to raise <strong>$375</strong> to subsidize the cost of camp for the kids. (Though you can donate right now at <a href="http://unicamp.org">their website</a>, if you wait a bit, it'll also count for my fundraising goal.) If you want to know more about UniCamp, see pictures, or hear stories, just let me know!</p>

	<h3>The <i>Daily Bruin</i> <a href="http://dailybruin.com">(dailybruin.com)</a></h3>
	<article>
	<p>For some reason, I decided that I loved journalism in high school. I don't think I'm that great of a writer, but the entire journalistic mission and process is just fascinating. As a junior in high school, I started the school newspaper, the <i>Raiders' Arrow</i>. Though in the first issue, I wrote all the articles, the paper expanded and other people started contributing more and more.</p>
	<p>However, I wanted to work for a real newspaper: designing and printing in 8.5" by 11" paper is one thing, but having daily production on an actual newspaper is completely different. At UCLA, I joined the <a href="http://dailybruin.com"><i>Daily Bruin</i></a>, the campus newspaper. I started my first year as a designer, but now I am an Assistant Design Director (or something like that: the title always confuses me). Basically, I oversee other designers and help handle higher-level design of the paper, besides just daily production. There are two other wonderful Assistant Design Directors and one head honcho: <em>the</em> Design Director.</p>

	<h3>Web Design/Computer Work</h3>
	<article>
	<p>In my free time, especially in the summer, I play around with computer: learn new programming languages, make new websites, design, etc. I have a lot of experience fixing computers: my parents, family, and friends have been asking for help since I started high school. Some things about computers are incredible. For instance, I can't get over how amazing ethernet cables, routers, and wireless networks are. Some geniuses came up with it and now it's amazing!</p>
	<p>As you can probably tell, I love working with computers. (After all, it <em>is</em> my major.) If you'd like me to do any work for you or you know anyone who wants me to work for them, just <a href="?p=contact">send me a message</a>; we can work something out. And during UniCamp season, I always give a portion of what I made to UniCamp!</p>
